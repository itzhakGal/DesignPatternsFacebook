## üîß Design Patterns Used

- **Observer Pattern**: This pattern is used to track changes in user activities and update the Personality Insights in real-time. When the user performs an action (like posting or updating), the insights are updated.
- **Strategy Pattern**: The Personal Goal Tracker uses different strategies for various goal categories (e.g., health, career, education), allowing flexibility in how goals are handled and displayed.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that certain components, such as the Insights and Goal Tracker, have only one instance throughout the application for consistency.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to complex functionalities, such as analyzing user sentiment or suggesting relevant Facebook pages.
